This repo contains our Twitterbot project for LMC 2700 at Georgia Tech, taught by Dr. Jay David Bolter. 
The Twitterbot, @GordanSeyRam, spoofs Gordon Ramsay by posting memes and famous Ramsay quotes and replying to @mentions with a rating and review.
The Twitterbot aims at being interactive, by periodically retweeting content tagged with the hashtag #GordonRamsay, liking posts with various
Ramsay-related hashtags, and following back any account that follows the bot or @mentions the bot in a tweet.
